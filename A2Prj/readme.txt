//Had to switch from Creately to Violet because Creatly was giving me trouble.  

//Didn't add all commands as it was making the diagram rather messy.  
//Added 1 command at the end that says additional commands go here...

//Also didn't write all the individual GameButtons declarations in  GameWorld 

//Wasn't entirely sure what you were looking for as far as test cases for the Third Deliverable
// so I took a few screenshots with all the parts still working.  


//Regarding the required aggregation relationship between missile and missileLauncher, we emailed the teacher about it, and 
// he said we were fine without it because of the way we set up our constructor in missile with a boolean value to tell us whose missile it is. 
// I didn't want to bother you about the last 3 points, since you gave us back 6 already.  Just wanted to make sure we weren't going to keep getting
// marked off on section 2 of the assignment.

// Our background music file is pretty big, so sometimes it doesn't automatically start up.  
// To solve the problem, you have to open up the simulator menu, press pause app, then resume app
// and it should start right up.  Sometimes it starts the first time, we call that a good one.
// We have notified the teacher, he told us to leave you this note.
